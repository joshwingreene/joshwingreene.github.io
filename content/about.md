## Welcome!

The name's Joshwin and I'm a Design-minded Full-Stack Developer. I got my start in tech when I started to co-develop and spearhead the design of [ScholarDev App](https://scholardevapps.com)'s mobile bus schedule, which was called [Fresno Transit Free](https://joshwingreene.com/portfolio/design/fresno-transit-free). That application was launched in 2014, garnered over 15,000 downloads on Google Play, and had a 4/5 star rating as of 2016. While designing and developing this app, I cultivated a strong passion for the creation of great user experiences and design in general.

Here’s a picture of my team and I when we tied for People’s Choice in a local hackathon called 59DaysofCode in 2013:
