## Welcome!

The name's Joshwin and I'm a Design-minded Full-Stack Developer. I got my start in tech when I started to co-develop and spearhead the design of [ScholarDev App](https://scholardevapps.com)'s mobile bus schedule, which was called [Fresno Transit Free](https://joshwingreene.com/portfolio/design/fresno-transit-free). That application was launched in 2014, garnered over 15,000 downloads on Google Play, and had a 4/5 star rating as of 2016. While designing and developing this app, I cultivated a strong passion for the creation of great user experiences and design in general.

Here’s a picture of my team and I when we tied for People’s Choice in a local hackathon called 59DaysofCode in 2013:

After gaining approximately five years of formal experience as a software developer, I'm now transitioning to Technical Writing. Why am I switching? To put it simply, I'm not a fan of the LeetCode-centric interview style of software engineering interviews, and I feel like the field is oversaturated. So, based on my [technical](https://joshwingreene.com/portfolio/dev/) and [user experience design](https://joshwingreene.com/portfolio/design/) backgrounds, my curiosity for tech, and my interest in writing, I believe that technical writing is a good fit for me.

Here's my answer to a recent question about what I enjoy about technical communication and writing:

> "My father makes it a point to frequently publish essays in the newspapers in my hometown. Because of this, I think his hobby rubbed off of me and got me interested in using the written word to spread my ideas with the world. As for technical communication, I like how I can combine my interest in writing with my technical know-how. I'm also a note-taking and personal knowledge management enthusiast. So, technical communication is right up my alley."
