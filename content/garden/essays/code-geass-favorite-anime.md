As someone who grew up putting Zoid and Gundam model kits together, it shouldn't be surprising that my favorite anime includes mechas or robots. Besides this aspect, there's so much to love. The intrigue, the suspense, the fights, the strategy... It's quite a compelling story. If you have yet to watch it, you should check out the [3 movies](https://www.crunchyroll.com/watch/GEVUZMEK4/code-geass-lelouch-of-the-rebellion-i-initiation) instead of the two seasons that include 25 episodes each. At this point, it feels like I'm watching at least one episode or scene every year. I just finished watching the [Letts React](https://www.youtube.com/@LettsReact) team react to the series, and it reminded me of why I like it so much.

Here's a great fan-made trailer:
