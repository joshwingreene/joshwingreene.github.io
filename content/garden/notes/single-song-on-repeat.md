I don't know about you, but I like to play music when I'm doing work. Now, I do make it a point to only listen to music that don't have vocals in them. Otherwise, I'm going to get distracted by the lyrics. Until recently, I have created playlists for different work moods I'm in. Here are a couple of my favorite work playlists: Halo Work Mix (Spotify Community Playlist), Chess Study (specific songs from Netflix's Queen's Gambit Series), and Workday Lounge (Spotify Playlist). However, more recently, I have found that listening to a single song, on repeat, is a good way to get into the zone more quickly. When listening to a playlist, I think I get distracted by the changes in the music. For me, that gets in the way of entering the "Flow State." In a way, I feel like this relates to how I like to see the intros of series that I watch, like Star Trek Discovery, Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber, and the Halo TV Series. I'm assuming that the majority of people like to skip them, but the intros help me to get into the atmosphere or tone of whatever I'm watching. In the same vein, a single song helps me to get into a relevant flow or atmosphere of whatever I'm working on. Now, whenever I'm feeling bored while working, that is when I change to a different song and play that song on repeat.

For those interested, here is a ranked list of songs that I like to play separately when I'm coding or writing:

**Album:** Super Pumped: The Battle For Uber (Music from the Showtime Original Series)
