## Overview

### Introduction

My teammates and I worked through a user-centered design process over the course of 6 weeks. In the end, we delivered a mobile, career resource guide.

Here’s what was asked of us in the brief that we were given:

> Help public libraries strengthen their community relationships and smooth the disruption of technology on their communities by: (1) Improving patrons’ skills (2) Helping patrons find employment (3) Preparing young people for a new labor market

### Background

This was a Flatiron School project.

### Final Presentation

Here’s a preview and a link to our final presentation for this project:
