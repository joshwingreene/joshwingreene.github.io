## Fresno Transit Free

This entry includes the most notable branding and marketing materials that I created for this project.

### App Icon

::image{src="../../images/misc-design-work/ftf-app-image.jpg"}

:::

This icon is heavily based on a bus graphic that is a part of the bus stop signs of the Fresno Area Express. This icon was used as the basis for the Android and iOS app icons. I generated the Android app icon using this [tool](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-launcher.html) whereas the iOS app icon was outsourced to the [graphic artist](https://www.facebook.com/samantha.siakovichinshaw) that we were working with at the time. She also helped me fine-tune this image.

The flier was used when we showed the iOS version at the competition’s showcase. The graphic that you see at the top was created by the aforementioned graphic artist.

The vertical banner was used when we showed the iOS version at the competition's showcase. Like the previous image, the graphic that you see towards the top is a modified form of the graphic that was created by the aforementioned graphic artist.

Like the flier and vertical banner, these product shots were created for the showcase.

### Post Launch

:::

This was the flier that was used when we released the app for both Android and iOS in April of 2014. **Note:** In the original PDF file, all of the preview screenshots have visible boundary lines around them.

In order to help us advertise the app, the Fresno Area Express gave us the opportunity to place bus placards in their buses. For reference, the majority of the above graphic was created by a graphic artist that we worked with. The original graphic is shown at the top of the flier that’s above this graphic.

This sticker was used to market the app at a tech conference in Fresno, CA. It uses the iOS app icon that was created by the aforementioned graphic artist.
