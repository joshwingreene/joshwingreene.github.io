## Overview

### Introduction

My teammate and I worked through a user-centered design process over the course of 5 weeks (4 sprints). In the end, we delivered a civic-based web solution.

Here’s what was asked of us in the brief that we were given:

> Design a microsite that streamlines the way citizens access relevant information and communicate with their elected representatives.

### Background

This was a Flatiron School project.

### Final Presentation

Here’s a preview and a link to our final presentation for this project:
